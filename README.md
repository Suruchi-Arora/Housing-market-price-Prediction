HOUSING MARKET PRICE PREDICTION-UTILIZING MULTIPLE ALGORITHMS

The accurate forecasting of house prices in real estate market can help both buyers and sellers improve their financial outcomes.

The  objective of this research project is to predict real estate prices in King County(KC), Washington, USA with using real-time parameters such as location, area, and condition of the property. To achieve this goal, the project will use three different machine learning techniques: Linear Regression, XG Gradient Boost, and Random Forest Regressor (Ensembler).

The criteria for comparing these models will be the r2 score and the machine learning model with lower error rate will be evaluatd and will be deployed.
